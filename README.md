# Customer-Data-Pre-processing
Customer Data Pre-processing: This repository focuses on Customer Data Pre-processing using standard python with no Pandas and Seaborn libraries. 
1. Customer Data Processing:
•	Read and process a CSV file containing customer data.
•	Convert flat data structures into nested structures for attributes like Vehicle, Credit Card, and Address.
•	Handle and correct errors in the dependants column.
•	Write processed data to JSON files.
•	Create separate JSON files for retired and employed customers.
•	Identify and write customers with credit card issues to a separate JSON file.
•	Calculate and add a new attribute called "Salary-Commute" and sort records by this metric.

2. Data Visualisation :
•	Utilize Pandas and Seaborn to visualize customer data.
•	Calculate mean salary and median age.
•	Create univariate plots for age, dependents, and age conditioned on marital status.
•	Generate multivariate plots for commute distance vs. salary, age vs. salary, and age vs. salary conditioned by dependants.
•	Include the ability to save the produced plots.

3. Code Presentation:
•	Ensure well-structured, logically organized, and well-commented code.
•	Use meaningful variable names and avoid scope conflicts.
•	Focus on code reusability and reduce boilerplate code.
•	Implement error handling where appropriate.
•	Utilize Markdown cells for clear task separation and documentation.
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with the complete code and output cells, demonstrating the data preprocessing and visualization tasks. It also contains various JSON output files generated during t
